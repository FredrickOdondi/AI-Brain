## Direct Seller Examples

### Example 1: Foreclosure - High Motivation (Subject-To Candidate)

**Subject:** Need to sell house ASAP - behind on payments

**Body:**
```
Hi,

I found your information online and I really need help. I'm 3 months behind on
my mortgage and the bank is threatening foreclosure. I live at 456 Oak Street
and I owe about $185,000 on the house. I think it's worth around $250,000 but
I'm not sure.

I lost my job 6 months ago and just can't keep up with the $1,650 monthly
payment anymore. I need to get out from under this before it ruins my credit
completely.

Can you help? I need to do something in the next 30 days.

Thanks,
Sarah Martinez
```

### Example 2: Inherited Property - Seller Finance Candidate

**Subject:** Inherited property - looking for buyer

**Body:**
```
Hello,

My mother passed away last year and I inherited her house at 789 Maple Avenue.
It's a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house that she owned free and clear - no mortgage. The
house is in decent shape but needs some updating (kitchen and bathrooms are from
the 1980s).

I live out of state and don't want to be a landlord. I've been told it's worth
around $180,000 but honestly I just want it sold so I don't have to deal with
it anymore. I'm not in a huge rush but would like to get it done in the next
few months.

I'm open to creative solutions if you have any ideas. I've heard about seller
financing but don't really know how it works.

Let me know if you're interested.

### Example 3: Divorce - Cash Offer Candidate

**Subject:** Need to sell house in divorce

**Body:**
```
I'm going through a divorce and need to sell our house at 321 Pine Street
quickly. Neither of us can afford to keep it and we just want to move on with
our lives.

The house needs some work - the roof is old and there's some foundation cracks
that need attention. We owe $140,000 on it and were told by a realtor it might
sell for $200,000 if we fix it up, but we don't have the money or time for that.

We need to close this out in 45 days if possible. Can you make an offer?

```

**Expected AI Response:**
- Sender Type: Direct Seller
- Deal Type: Cash (due to repairs needed and timeline)
- Motivation: High
- Issues: Repairs needed, timeline pressure, distressed sellers

### Example 4: Tired Landlord - Lease Option Candidate

**Subject:** Rental property for sale - flexible on terms

**Body:**
```
Hi there,

I've been a landlord for 15 years and I'm just tired of dealing with tenants,
repairs, and phone calls at 2am. I have a rental property at 555 Elm Street
that I'd like to sell.

The house is currently rented for $1,500/month (tenant has 6 months left on
lease). I owe about $120,000 on my mortgage with payments of $950/month. I think
the house is worth around $220,000.

I'm not in a rush to sell - I'd actually prefer to keep getting income for a
while longer but just don't want the management headaches. If there's a way to
structure this where I can get paid over time and not have to deal with the
tenant issues, I'm all ears.

What do you think?

Patricia Rodriguez

**Expected AI Response:**
- Sender Type: Direct Seller
- Deal Type: Lease Option or Seller Finance
- Motivation: Medium
- Situation: Tired landlord, wants passive income, not in rush

### Example 5: Job Relocation - Quick Close Needed

**Subject:** Moving out of state - need quick sale

**Body:**
```
I just accepted a job in California and need to relocate in 3 weeks. I need to
sell my house at 888 Birch Lane fast.

The house is in great condition - I just updated everything last year (new roof,
HVAC, kitchen). I owe $195,000 and recently had it appraised at $280,000 for a
refinance I was considering.

A realtor said it would take 60-90 days to sell traditionally but I don't have
that kind of time. I start my new job on Feb 15th and need to be there.

I know I'll probably have to take less than market value for a quick sale, but
I just need it handled fast. Can you close in 2-3 weeks?

**Expected AI Response:**
- Sender Type: Direct Seller

**Subject:** Re: Your offer on my property

**Body:**
```
Hi,

Thanks for getting back to me about my house. I'm interested in your offer but
I have a few questions:

1. How does seller financing actually work? I've never done that before.
2. What kind of down payment would you offer?
3. How long would the terms be?
4. Would I have to pay taxes on the monthly payments?

Also, I'm curious - what makes you think my house is worth $175,000? The tax
assessment says $210,000.

Let me know when we can talk more about this.

Sarah
```

**Subject:** Re: Offer on 123 Main Street

**Body:**
```
Thank you for your offer of $220,000 cash with 14-day close on 123 Main Street.

My seller has reviewed your offer and would like to counter at $235,000 with
all other terms remaining the same. The seller feels this is fair given the
recent comparable sales in the neighborhood and the excellent condition of the
property.

Please let me know if your buyer is willing to accept this counter-offer. The
seller is motivated but wants to ensure they're getting fair market value.

I'll need a response by end of business tomorrow as we have another showing
scheduled and expect a second offer.

Best regards,
Jennifer Adams
Keller Williams Realty
```

**Expected AI Response:**
- Professional counter-counter or acceptance
- Justify offer with comps and analysis
- Maintain professional relationship
- Express continued interest
